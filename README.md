# Ego-Motion Estimation
This repository contains **design** and **implementation** of ego-motion estimation techniques for various sensor types and sensor combinations. These concepts and the techniques can be applied in domains like **robotic perception**, **autonomous driving** and **advance driver assistance system applications**. These projects are ongoing, and several other ego-motion estimation techniques might be added and the existing ones might be enhanced in the future. Hope that the community finds these projects useful :)
